  Canonical prompt templates tuned for drywall inspection datasets (standard drywall defects and
  crack-heavy exports). Copy the relevant `prompt` strings into `configs/<exp>.yaml` to drive
  open-vocabulary detection.

prompt_sets:
  - label: exposed_joint_tape
    priority: high
    context: "Where joint compound coverage is thin or tape edges are visible."
    prompts:
      - text: "highlight exposed drywall joint tape or bubbling tape"
      - text: "segment joint tape that is visible through mud"
    negative_prompts:
      - text: "ignore proper joints with even compound"

  - label: screw_pop
    priority: medium
    context: "Fasteners protruding or sunken, often circular."
    prompts:
      - text: "find screw pops, nail pops, or fastener heads"
      - text: "detect protruding drywall screws"
    negative_prompts:
      - text: "ignore light reflections or small paint dots"

  - label: crack
    priority: high
    context: "Cracks across seams, corners, or randomly on panels."
    prompts:
      - text: "segment drywall cracks or splits"
      - text: "find linear cracks along drywall seams"
      - text: "highlight spider cracks in drywall"
    negative_prompts:
      - text: "ignore interior corner shadows"

  - label: compound_streak
    priority: medium
    context: "Areas where compound ridges or knife lines appear."
    prompts:
      - text: "find uneven joint compound streaks"
      - text: "highlight ridged or grooved drywall mud"

  - label: unpainted_surface
    priority: low
    context: "Unprimed drywall or patches missing paint."
    prompts:
      - text: "segment unpainted drywall patches"
